Save Files

In this lesson, you will become familiar with how to read and write to a relational database which we will use to save our game progress.

Some minor updates:  Link's PNG file now doesn't include the grey box around him.  You are welcome to use the updated PNG.  Also I have added the intro screen music and the save screen png.  You will need to place those in your program file folder.

game1.11.py is the game file we will start with today along with pygame_functions10.py from last time.  game1.11.1.py is the completed game file at the end of the video as well as pygame_functions11.py is the finished functions file.

Extensions:  
1. What if we want to also save link's kill count in the database.  Delete the current database file.  Alter the python_functions code to make another field when making the table.  The kills field should have integer datatype.
2. When you save a file, it should now include the kill count
3. When you load a file, it should now include the kill count
4. Test your code by having the kill count printed in the console.  Make sure that when you save a game, exit the game, and then reload the same game, that the kill count loads correctly
