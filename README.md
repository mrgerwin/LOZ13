Save Files

In this lesson, you will become familiar with how to read and write to a relational database which we will use to save our game progress.

Extensions:  
1. What if we want to also save link's kill count in the database.  Delete the current database file.  Alter the python_functions code to make another field when making the table.  The kills field should have integer datatype.
2. When you save a file, it should now include the kill count
3. When you load a file, it should now include the kill count
4. Test your code by having the kill count printed in the console.  Make sure that when you save a game, exit the game, and then reload the same game, that the kill count loads correctly
